==========
Add responsive background images to your Meteor.js app. This package includes all the Javascript and CSS you need to have beautiful background images that fill the width of your container. This package works well with both moble or desktop applications. The code is based off of a [minimint.com](http://www.minimit.com/articles/solutions-tutorials/fullscreen-backgrounds-with-centered-content) article and has been adapted to Meteor with a few extra features.

More information to come :)
